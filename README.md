Great Decisions Perfect Timing. In development.

Content Checklist:

- [x] Media Kit: Paulo editing individual pieces as needed, but all pieces are linked to and editable
- [x] Public Speaking Profile: going to start with what’s at http://divination.com/about/speaker/ so would be good to have Paulo give that a review & touch-up.
- [ ] Populate Synchronistic Living Forums - https://muut.com/synchronicity - and then add it (link to it) on the site
- [ ] Events: any scheduled interviews, whether TV or radio ... and maybe one that we host on a Google hangout as sort of a virtual book reading? 
- [ ] Book Trailer on You Tube: I believe I heard a “yes” to wanting a video
- [ ] Facebook page for the book - https://www.facebook.com/GreatDecisionsPerfectTiming?ref=greatdecisionsperfecttiming.com [add a like button]
- [x] Amazon page for the book is done & linked to for pre-orders
- [x] Jewel: when images are finalized, track down license info and post credits if required
