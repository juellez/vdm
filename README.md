Great Decisions Perfect Timing. In development.

Content Checklist:

- [ ] Media Kit: will include an Interviews cheat sheet, 
- [x] Public Speaking Profile: going to start with what’s at http://divination.com/about/speaker/ so would be good to have Paulo give that a review & touch-up.
- [ ] Events: any scheduled interviews, whether TV or radio … and maybe one that we host on a Google hangout as sort of a virtual book reading? 
- [ ] Book Trailer on You Tube: I believe I heard a “yes” to wanting a video
- [ ] Facebook page for the book
- [ ] Amazon page for the book: you mentioned looking into what we can do for pre-sales on Amazon, so this could be the pre-sale page?
